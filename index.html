    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My work experiences are that I have not worked in any field that uses computer science. Some of the previous work experience is that I've worked as a coach since my senior year of high school in Men's Volleyball, and I've worked at Potbelly Sandwiches for 4 months. In addition to being a junior in college. I'm on my college's D1 Men's Volleyball team. In my mind being on the team gives me a great work ethic and to push through hard times. My time at college has taught me to be a good teammate to people I may not get along with. This has also helped me off the court when I've worked on projects with people I don't know. I am able to be a good teammate here. I have also learned how to get through hard times with marjory breaking my hand and not being able to use it for four and half months really taught me to push through even if you're in a tough situation. My knowledge for coding is that I feel like I'm strong at using python and html. Then I feel that I have a basic understanding of Java, javascript and C++. so that's me in a nutshell.
